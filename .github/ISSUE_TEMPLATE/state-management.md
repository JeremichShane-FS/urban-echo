## State: [State Name]

### Data to be Tracked

* [List the specific data points that need to be tracked within this state.]
    * Example: `currentUser`: `object` - Stores the currently logged-in user's information.
    * Example: `isLoading`: `boolean` - Indicates whether a data-fetching operation is in progress.
    * Example: `errorMessage`: `string` - Stores any error messages related to this state.

### Components with Access

* [List the components that will need to read or modify this state.]
    * Example: `LoginFormComponent`
    * Example: `UserProfileComponent`
    * Example: `ProductListComponent`

### Proposed Implementation

* [Specify the chosen state management approach and provide justification.]
    * Example: `Context API with useReducer hook` - Provides a lightweight and efficient solution for managing authentication state.
    * Example: `Redux Toolkit` - Suitable for managing complex global state with multiple reducers and actions.
    * Example: `Recoil` - Good for fine grained state management, and better performance for large applications.
    * Example: `Zustand` - Good for simple state management and performance.

### State Transitions and Actions

* [Describe the possible state transitions and the actions that trigger them.]
    * **Initial State:** `[Describe the initial state]`
        * Example: `currentUser: null, isLoading: false, errorMessage: null`
    * **Actions:**
        * `LOGIN_REQUEST`: `[Describe the action and its effect on the state]`
            * Example: Sets `isLoading` to `true`.
        * `LOGIN_SUCCESS`: `[Describe the action and its effect on the state]`
            * Example: Sets `currentUser` to the logged-in user object and `isLoading` to `false`.
        * `LOGIN_FAILURE`: `[Describe the action and its effect on the state]`
            * Example: Sets `errorMessage` to the error message and `isLoading` to `false`.
        * `LOGOUT`: `[Describe the action and its effect on the state]`
            * Example: Sets `currentUser` to `null`.
        * ... (add all relevant actions)
    * **State Transitions:**
        * `[Initial State] -> LOGIN_REQUEST -> [Loading State]`
        * `[Loading State] -> LOGIN_SUCCESS -> [Authenticated State]`
        * `[Loading State] -> LOGIN_FAILURE -> [Error State]`
        * `[Authenticated State] -> LOGOUT -> [Initial State]`
        * ... (add all state transitions)
