## ♻️ Refactoring Proposal

**🎯 Target:**

<!-- Example: User authentication service (src/services/auth/) -->

### 🔍 Current State

<!-- Example: The authentication service is currently 1500+ lines in a single file with mixed responsibilities. It handles login, registration, password management, session tracking, and permission checking all in one class. This makes it difficult to test and maintain. -->

### 💡 Proposed Changes

<!-- Example: Split the service into smaller, focused modules:
1. AuthenticationService - login/logout functionality
2. UserRegistrationService - user signup and verification
3. PasswordService - reset, change, and validation
4. SessionService - session management
5. PermissionService - access control checks -->

### 📊 Benefits

<!-- Check all that apply to your proposal -->

- [ ] Improves readability
- [ ] Enhances maintainability
- [ ] Increases performance
- [ ] Reduces complexity
- [ ] Other: **\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***

### ⚠️ Risks

<!-- Example:
1. Potential for regression bugs during refactoring
2. Services have many interdependencies
3. Will require updating multiple tests
4. May need to maintain backward compatibility for API consumers -->

### ✅ Implementation Plan

<!-- Example steps for implementing the refactoring -->

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3

### 🧪 Verification Strategy

<!-- Example:
1. Maintain high test coverage throughout the refactoring
2. Implement comprehensive integration tests before starting
3. Set up feature flags to roll out changes gradually
4. Perform A/B testing with both implementations -->

### 📝 Additional Context

<!-- Example: This refactoring aligns with our technical roadmap goal of improving code maintainability. Similar refactoring was successfully done for the payment service last quarter. -->
