# BRANCH POLICY ENFORCEMENT WORKFLOW
# =================================================================
# Purpose: Enforces Git workflow standards for production deployments
# Trigger: Pull requests targeting the main (production) branch
# Policy: Only staging branch can merge into main branch
#
# This workflow ensures proper deployment flow:
# feature/dev → staging → main (production)
#
# Benefits:
# - Prevents direct commits to production
# - Ensures all changes go through staging testing
# - Maintains stable production environment
# - Enforces proper code review process
# =================================================================

  # VALIDATE PULL REQUEST SOURCE BRANCH
  # =================================================================
  # Ensures that only the staging branch can create PRs to main
  # This enforces the proper deployment pipeline and prevents
