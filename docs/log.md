## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

### Week 1

**⚙️ Overview** - What I worked on this past week:

- Worked on the tech stack documentation, including updates to the deployment section with Vercel details and defining the e-commerce tech stack architecture.
- Created a detailed GitHub issue template for the proposal and added step-by-step instructions for branch creation and pull requests.
- Focused on research by documenting key concepts related to Git workflows and feature branch strategies in the _R1-Notes.md_ file.
- Merged branches and performed necessary Git operations, including merging feature branches and managing pull requests.

**🌵 Challenges** - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them:

- Encountered an issue where I accidentally merged one of my feature branches directly into **main**, bypassing **dev** and **staging** branches. I had to revert the merge and ensure the proper workflow is followed moving forward.

**🏆 Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week:

- Gained a better understanding of Git workflows and proper branching strategies. Successfully worked with Git branches and pull requests, correcting mistakes to maintain a clean repository.
- Improved my documentation practices by creating detailed, structured templates for the proposal and tech stack.

**🔮 Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next:

- For the upcoming week, I’ll focus on completing the wireframe for the application design and i'll research another topic for my research assignments, refining the application's structure and ensuring the wireframes accurately represent the design.
- I'll also work on defining the visual style and ensuring consistency across the application.
- Additionally, I plan to develop the Style Tile to align the design with the overall branding.
- I’ll continue participating in Stand Up Discussions to share progress and keep the team updated.
- Finally, I’ll begin preparing for dev's PR in milestone 2, ensuring all necessary components are in place for a strong submission.

### Week 2

**⚙️ Overview** - What I worked on this past week

- This week I focused on documentation work for our project. I uploaded wireframes for all major pages (Cart, Home, Payment, Product, Shipping, and Shop) and organized them in the docs/wires directory to serve as reference during development.
- I also created R2-Notes documenting my research on wireframing best practices and completed a first draft of our style tile, though some creative decisions are still in progress.

**🌵 Challenges** - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them

- While working on the style tile, I found it challenging to finalize some design decisions without having the store name locked down. I'm addressing this by creating a flexible design system that can accommodate different naming options while still maintaining visual cohesion across the site.

**🏆 Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week

- I leveled up on my wireframing skills this week. Through my research (documented in R2-Notes), I gained deeper understanding of wireframing best practices and common pitfalls to avoid. This allowed me to create more thoughtful, user-centered wireframes that better communicate our design intentions.

**🔮 Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next

- Next, I plan to dive into my UI/UX Key Concepts assignment by expanding on the wireframes with proper design theory application.
- I'll be conducting Research 4 on Design Theory to inform my decisions as I move from wireframes to a functional prototype.
- I also need to start thinking about production aspects, including gathering information for Research 5 (Plans for Production) and documenting key production concepts that will guide our implementation phase.
- I’ll continue participating in Stand Up Discussions to share progress and keep the team updated.
- Finally, I’ll begin preparing for dev's PR in milestone 3, ensuring all necessary components are in place for a strong submission.

### Week 3

Stay tuned, this stand up is coming soon...
