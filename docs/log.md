  - **API Endpoint Development**: Set up foundational API routes for about content management, dynamic hero content integration, products, featured products, and new arrivals
  - **ESLint Configuration Overhaul**: Added new linting libraries (jsxA11y, sonarjs, unicorn) and created a professional-grade ESLint configuration tailored for e-commerce applications
  - **Design System Cleanup**: Simplified the product design system by removing unused components, templates, and empty placeholder files
  - **Code Documentation**: Enhanced TODO comments across multiple hooks (useNewsletter.js, useSearchbar.js, useHomePage.js, etc.) to better outline API integration requirements
  - **Research Documentation**: Created comprehensive research notes (R9-Notes.md) covering innovation, security, SWOT analysis, and development planning

**üåµ Challenges** - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them:

- **ESLint Migration Complexity**: The biggest challenge was updating the ESLint configuration with new plugins, which introduced numerous linting errors across the entire codebase. This required:
  - Fixing import path restrictions by removing '@/' prefixes and using proper aliases
  - Adding comprehensive PropTypes validation for all React components
  - Resolving module resolution errors throughout the design system
  - Updating file naming conventions (productService.js ‚Üí product-service.js)

- **Solution**: Systematically worked through each error category, starting with import path fixes, then PropTypes validation, ensuring the codebase now adheres to professional e-commerce development standards.

**üèÜ Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week:
