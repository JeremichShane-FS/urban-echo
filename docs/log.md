## üì¢ &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

### Week 1

**‚öôÔ∏è Overview** - What I worked on this past week:

- Worked on the tech stack documentation, including updates to the deployment section with Vercel details and defining the e-commerce tech stack architecture.
- Created a detailed GitHub issue template for the proposal and added step-by-step instructions for branch creation and pull requests.
- Focused on research by documenting key concepts related to Git workflows and feature branch strategies in the _R1-Notes.md_ file.
- Merged branches and performed necessary Git operations, including merging feature branches and managing pull requests.

**üåµ Challenges** - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them:

- Encountered an issue where I accidentally merged one of my feature branches directly into **main**, bypassing **dev** and **staging** branches. I had to revert the merge and ensure the proper workflow is followed moving forward.

**üèÜ Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week:

- Gained a better understanding of Git workflows and proper branching strategies. Successfully worked with Git branches and pull requests, correcting mistakes to maintain a clean repository.
- Improved my documentation practices by creating detailed, structured templates for the proposal and tech stack.

**üîÆ Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next:

- For the upcoming week, I‚Äôll focus on completing the wireframe for the application design and i'll research another topic for my research assignments, refining the application's structure and ensuring the wireframes accurately represent the design.
- I'll also work on defining the visual style and ensuring consistency across the application.
- Additionally, I plan to develop the Style Tile to align the design with the overall branding.
- I‚Äôll continue participating in Stand Up Discussions to share progress and keep the team updated.
- Finally, I‚Äôll begin preparing for dev's PR in milestone 2, ensuring all necessary components are in place for a strong submission.

### Week 2

**‚öôÔ∏è Overview** - What I worked on this past week

- This week I focused on documentation work for our project. I uploaded wireframes for all major pages (Cart, Home, Payment, Product, Shipping, and Shop) and organized them in the docs/wires directory to serve as reference during development.
- I also created R2-Notes documenting my research on wireframing best practices and completed a first draft of our style tile, though some creative decisions are still in progress.

**üåµ Challenges** - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them

- While working on the style tile, I found it challenging to finalize some design decisions without having the store name locked down. I'm addressing this by creating a flexible design system that can accommodate different naming options while still maintaining visual cohesion across the site.

**üèÜ Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week

- I leveled up on my wireframing skills this week. Through my research (documented in R2-Notes), I gained deeper understanding of wireframing best practices and common pitfalls to avoid. This allowed me to create more thoughtful, user-centered wireframes that better communicate our design intentions.

**üîÆ Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next

- Next, I plan to dive into my UI/UX Key Concepts assignment by expanding on the wireframes with proper design theory application.
- I'll be conducting Research 4 on Design Theory to inform my decisions as I move from wireframes to a functional prototype.
- I also need to start thinking about production aspects, including gathering information for Research 5 (Plans for Production) and documenting key production concepts that will guide our implementation phase.
- I‚Äôll continue participating in Stand Up Discussions to share progress and keep the team updated.
- Finally, I‚Äôll begin preparing for dev's PR in milestone 3, ensuring all necessary components are in place for a strong submission.

### Week 3

**‚öôÔ∏è Overview** - What I worked on this past week

- Completed comprehensive research on design theory, documenting key UX laws, principles of visual hierarchy, and best practices for interface elements (documented in R4-Notes).
- Conducted research on production planning, focusing on RESTful API design, documentation-driven development, and atomic design principles (documented in R5-Notes).
- Standardized the formatting across all research documents for consistency.
- Shifted focus to prototyping the user interface in Figma, based on the wireframes and style tile.
- Began working on the "Component: Navigation Bar" and "Component: Product Card" issues in preparation for Milestone 4.

**üåµ Challenges** - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them

- The main challenge this week was needing to adjust the project timeline slightly. I realized that completing the full prototype within Milestone 3 was too ambitious, so I've moved the prototyping work to Milestone 4. This allows for more dedicated time to ensure the prototype is well-developed and incorporates the design theory research.

**üèÜ Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week

- Significantly improved my understanding of design theory and how it applies to UI/UX design. The in-depth research on UX laws and design principles will be invaluable in creating a user-centered interface.
- Gained a better understanding of production planning and best practices for API design and documentation. This knowledge will be crucial as we move into the development phase.

**üîÆ Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next

- Prioritize completing the Figma prototype for Milestone 4, ensuring it aligns with the wireframes, style tile, and design theory research.
- Continue working on the component issues ("Component: Navigation Bar" and "Component: Product Card") to prepare for development.
- Begin the initial setup of the Next.js project and potentially start implementing basic components.
- I‚Äôll continue participating in Stand Up Discussions to share progress and keep the team updated.
- Finally, I‚Äôll begin preparing for dev's PR in milestone 4, ensuring all necessary components are in place for a strong submission.

### Week 4

**‚öôÔ∏è Overview** - What I worked on this past week

- Created SVG assets for the Urban Echo brand, including the main logo, navbar compact logo, and favicon
- Set up the base Next.js project structure with proper layout.js and page.js configurations
- Created a comprehensive implementation guide document outlining the project structure, SASS setup, and next steps
- Fixed SASS integration issues that were causing import errors in previous attempts
- Defined the brand identity with a consistent color scheme (dark gray #333333, orange #E67E22, blue #4A90A7, off-white #F7F7F7)
- Prepared metadata for SEO optimization in the layout.js file
- Started building the foundation for responsive design with proper viewport settings

**üåµ Challenges** - What problems did I had & how I'm addressing them

- Encountered issues with SASS module imports, which I resolved by implementing a proper directory structure and updating the import syntax to use `@use` and `@forward` instead of the deprecated `@import` method
- Needed to balance creative decisions while maintaining a cohesive brand identity across different logo formats (main, compact, favicon)
- Worked through the challenge of organizing the project structure to support scalability as more components are added

**üèÜ Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week

- Significantly improved my SVG design skills by creating multiple variations of the Urban Echo logo that maintain brand consistency across different contexts and sizes
- Enhanced my understanding of Next.js 13+ project structure, particularly with the new app directory and metadata handling
- Developed a more systematic approach to project organization that will support the e-commerce functionality as it grows
- Created a comprehensive implementation guide that not only helps me but would also support any team members who join the project

**üîÆ Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next

- Implement the major components outlined in the implementation guide, starting with the Navbar and Footer
- Begin building the home page sections (HeroSection, FeaturedCategories, NewArrivals, Newsletter)
- Set up the product component structure and implement the ProductCard component
- Begin the MongoDB integration for product data storage
- Start implementing Auth0 for user authentication
- Begin the framework for the shopping cart functionality
- Prepare for the development of dynamic product pages

My final stand up reflects a productive week of establishing the foundation for the Urban Echo e-commerce platform, with significant progress on branding, project structure, and technical setup.
