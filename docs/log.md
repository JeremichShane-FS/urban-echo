## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

### Week 1

**⚙️ Overview** - What I worked on this past week:

- Worked on the tech stack documentation, including updates to the deployment section with Vercel details and defining the e-commerce tech stack architecture.
- Created a detailed GitHub issue template for the proposal and added step-by-step instructions for branch creation and pull requests.
- Focused on research by documenting key concepts related to Git workflows and feature branch strategies in the _R1-Notes.md_ file.
- Merged branches and performed necessary Git operations, including merging feature branches and managing pull requests.

**🌵 Challenges** - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them:

- Encountered an issue where I accidentally merged one of my feature branches directly into **main**, bypassing **dev** and **staging** branches. I had to revert the merge and ensure the proper workflow is followed moving forward.

**🏆 Accomplishments** - What is something I "leveled up" on this week:

- Gained a better understanding of Git workflows and proper branching strategies. Successfully worked with Git branches and pull requests, correcting mistakes to maintain a clean repository.
- Improved my documentation practices by creating detailed, structured templates for the proposal and tech stack.

**🔮 Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next:

- For the upcoming week, I’ll focus on completing the wireframe for the application design and i'll research another topic for my research assignments, refining the application's structure and ensuring the wireframes accurately represent the design. I'll also work on defining the visual style and ensuring consistency across the application. Additionally, I plan to develop the Style Tile to align the design with the overall branding. I’ll continue participating in Stand Up Discussions to share progress and keep the team updated. Finally, I’ll begin preparing for dev's PR in milestone 2, ensuring all necessary components are in place for a strong submission.
