## Topic - Web Design Visual Elements

This document contains general notes related to key visual design elements for web applications, including style tiles, typography, color theory, and textures.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Style Tiles

Style tiles serve as a design deliverable that bridges the gap between mood boards and full mockups.

- Style tiles establish a direct connection with interface elements without defining layout, making them ideal for translating established brands to the web
- They help form a common visual language between designers and stakeholders, similar to how interior designers use paint chips and fabric swatches
- The process involves listening to client needs, interpreting feedback into design principles, and defining a visual language that can be iterated upon

## Sub-Topic 2 - Typography and Brand Fonts

Typography plays a crucial role in shaping brand identity and user perception.

- Font categories convey different personalities:
  - Serif fonts: Classic, traditional, trustworthy
  - Sans-serif fonts: Modern, clean, minimal
  - Script/Handwritten fonts: Elegant, informal, artistic
- Brand fonts must meet three key requirements:
  - Flexibility across all mediums (print, web, mobile)
  - Multiple font weights for clear text hierarchy
  - Legibility in all contexts
- Font selection should align with brand personality and consider budget/licensing requirements

## Sub-Topic 3 - Color Theory and Implementation

Color selection is fundamental to effective web design and brand communication.

- Color psychology impacts user perception:
  - Red: Urgency, bold emotion
  - Blue: Trust, security, calmness
  - Green: Growth, health, serenity
- Implementation best practices:
  - Primary color: Used for key calls-to-action and important information
  - Secondary colors: For highlighting less important elements
  - Neutral colors: For text, backgrounds, and supporting elements
- Consider contrast and accessibility when implementing color schemes
