## Development and Production Planning

This document contains research notes on best practices for API design, documentation-driven development, and component-based design patterns.

## RESTful API Design Principles

Research on effective API design patterns and best practices.

- Key principles for API design:

  - Keep base URLs simple and resource-focused
  - Use nouns instead of verbs in endpoints
  - Utilize proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE)
  - Use plural naming conventions consistently
  - Implement proper versioning (e.g., /v1/products)
  - Include pagination for large data sets
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Provide clear error messages and documentation

- Common mistakes to avoid:
  - Using verbs in URLs (e.g., /getAllProducts)
  - Inconsistent naming conventions
  - Poor error handling
  - Lack of versioning
  - Missing pagination for large datasets

## Documentation-Driven Development

Research on the benefits and implementation of documentation-first approaches.

- Key benefits of documentation-driven development:

  - Forces thorough planning before coding begins
  - Creates clear blueprints for development
  - Helps identify potential issues early
  - Improves consistency in implementation
  - Serves as pseudo-code for development
  - Makes feature scope more visible

- Implementation strategies:
  - Write user documentation before coding
  - Treat documentation as living code
  - Include documentation in version control
  - Update docs before implementing changes
  - Use docs for feature request evaluation
  - Create documentation that serves as a roadmap

## Atomic Design Implementation

Research on component-based design patterns and implementation.

- Core concepts of atomic design:

  - Break interfaces into fundamental building blocks
  - Create reusable components at various levels
  - Maintain consistency through shared elements
  - Build scalable and maintainable systems

- Implementation levels:
  - Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
  - Molecules: Simple component groups
  - Organisms: Complex component sections
  - Templates: Page-level layouts
  - Pages: Specific instance of templates

**Note:**  
The documentation-driven development resource was particularly valuable in understanding how proper planning and documentation can lead to more focused and efficient development processes. The API design guide provided excellent practical examples of how to structure and implement scalable APIs.
