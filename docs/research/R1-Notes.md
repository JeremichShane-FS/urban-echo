# R1-Notes: Research on Git Workflows

## Research Topic

Feature Branch Workflow and Efficient Research Documentation

## Key Concepts

1. **Feature Branch Workflow**:

   - Purpose: To isolate development work for specific features.
   - Process:
     1. Create a new branch for the feature.
     2. Commit and push changes to the feature branch.
     3. Merge the branch into the main branch after review.

2. **Documenting Research in Markdown**:
   - Markdown is lightweight and ideal for research notes.
   - Key elements to include in research documentation:
     - Topic Overview
     - Key Findings
     - Challenges and Solutions
     - Resources Used

## Weekly Progress

- Created the `research` branch in Git.
- Duplicated and updated `R1-Notes.md` with initial research notes.
