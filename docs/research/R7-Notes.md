## Topic - Project Initiation and Discovery

This document contains general notes related to project initiation, discovery processes, and evaluating project readiness. The research focuses on understanding how to properly kick off a project, identify stakeholders, and ensure alignment before development begins.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Project Discovery and Selection

Brief overview of research on finding and choosing the right projects.

- **Project Discovery Process**: Discovery is the process by which organizations review available opportunities and decide which will become projects. It involves identifying opportunities, comparing them, and ranking to decide which to undertake.
- **Value Creation Focus**: Projects should deliver clear business value - either increase income, decrease costs, improve productivity, or reduce risk. All projects must tie back to measurable business benefits.
- **Opportunity vs Project Distinction**: At discovery stage, focus on problems and gaps rather than solutions. The project comes after identifying the opportunity that needs addressing.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Stakeholder Identification and Project Kickoff

Brief overview of research on identifying who matters and how to start projects properly.

- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Stakeholders are anyone who holds a stake in the project outcome - including end users, management, IT staff, customers, and even external groups. Must identify both obvious and less obvious stakeholders early.
- **Project Board Structure**: Should consist of project sponsor (decision maker/customer), technical advisor, and business advisor/domain expert. Keep board small (3 people) to enable efficient decision-making.
- **Kickoff Meeting Importance**: Brings together key players to officially start the project, align expectations, and build enthusiasm. Should cover PID highlights, project approach, communication plan, and immediate next steps.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 3 - Project Readiness and Evaluation Criteria

Brief overview of research on determining if a project is ready to begin and evaluation methods.

- **Startup Evaluation Framework**: Y Combinator evaluates ideas based on problem-solution fit, market size, team capability, and execution potential. Projects should solve real problems that people are willing to pay for.
- **Project Readiness Indicators**: Good projects have defined business benefits with metrics, strategic importance to organization, sufficient resources, and internal supporters. Bad projects lack clear benefits, focus too much on present vs future, have insufficient resources, or limited organizational support.
- **Kickoff vs Contract Distinction**: Kickoff meeting occurs when everyone agrees on project scope, right before contract signing. After contract, development becomes primary focus. Statement of Work (SOW) should include proposal, wireframes, and technical specifications.

## My Urban Echo Project Evaluation

**Is my project ready to kick off?**

- ✅ Clear business value: E-commerce platform addresses real market need ($1.2T fashion market)
- ✅ Defined target market: Tech-savvy consumers aged 18-45 with specific pain points
- ✅ Technical feasibility: Using proven tech stack (Next.js, MongoDB, Auth0, Stripe)
- ✅ Clear scope: Auth, product browsing, cart management, secure payments
- ⚠️ **Needs work**: More detailed stakeholder analysis and project board structure
- ⚠️ **Needs work**: Formal success metrics and measurement criteria

**My 30-Second Pitch:**
"Urban Echo is a modern e-commerce platform that solves the frustration busy professionals face with slow, complicated online clothing shopping. Using Next.js and secure payment processing, we deliver a fast, intuitive shopping experience that reduces cart abandonment and increases customer satisfaction. Unlike competitors like ASOS with their complex navigation, Urban Echo focuses on speed and simplicity - think Amazon's ease with boutique-quality curation. We're targeting the $1.2 trillion fashion e-commerce market, specifically tech-savvy consumers aged 18-45 who value convenience and security."

**Note:**  
The discovery and initiation phase is crucial for project success. Without proper stakeholder alignment and clear success criteria, even technically excellent projects can fail to deliver business value. My Urban Echo project has strong fundamentals but needs more detailed planning around measurement and governance structure before full development begins.
