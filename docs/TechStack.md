# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## üé® Application Design

I will use Figma for creating click-through designs of the e-commerce store. This will include:

- Product listing pages
- Product detail views
- Shopping cart interface
- Checkout flow
- User authentication screens

For styling, I'll implement SASS for custom styling solutions, allowing for:

- Reusable design variables
- Nested selectors
- Mixins for responsive design
- Modular CSS architecture

## ‚öõÔ∏è Front End Framework

I will use Next.js as the primary framework, leveraging its key features:

- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- API routes for backend functionality
- Image optimization for product images
- Dynamic routing for product pages
- Built-in React components
- Static page generation for faster loading
- Incremental Static Regeneration for product updates

## üè™ State Management

The state management solution will include:

- Next.js built-in data fetching methods
- Context API for cart management
- Local Storage for persisting cart items
- MongoDB for product and order data
- Auth0 for user session management

## üì° Node

Next.js provides an integrated solution for both frontend and backend, using Node.js under the hood. I will utilize:

- API routes for server-side logic
- Environment variables for secure configuration
- NPM for package management
- Integration with external services (Stripe, Auth0)

## üöÄ Express

While Express won't be directly used (as Next.js handles routing), the API routes will be structured similarly with:

- RESTful endpoints for product management
- Authentication middleware using Auth0
- Route handlers for:
- Product queries
- Cart operations
- Order processing
- Payment integration with Stripe

## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB

Instead of SQL/Postgres, I will use MongoDB as the database solution:

- Mongoose ODM for data modeling
- Schema validation
- CRUD operations for:
- Products
- Orders
- User data
- Indexing for search optimization
- Data relationships between:
- Users and Orders
- Products and Categories

## üöÄ Deployment

I will use Vercel for deploying the application, which provides:

- Continuous deployment
- Custom domain support
- Serverless functions

## Change Order

#### 1. Project Scope Confirmation

The Proposal and Tech Stack documents accurately summarize the current project scope for the Urban Echo e-commerce platform. The scope includes:

- Modern e-commerce platform for clothing retail
- Next.js frontend with CSS styling
- MongoDB database with user authentication via Auth0
- Stripe payment processing integration
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Product browsing, cart management, and secure checkout functionality

#### 2. Remaining Work Estimate

Approximately **4-6 weeks** of development work remains for **Version 1 (Core MVP)**, broken down as follows:

- **Week 1-2**: Complete component development (Navbar, Footer, Product Cards, etc.)
- **Week 3-4**: Implement authentication system and user management
- **Week 5-6**: Build product catalog, shopping cart functionality, and payment processing integration

**Version 1 Scope**: Core e-commerce functionality including user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and secure checkout. Subsequent versions with enhanced features planned for future development cycles.

#### 3. Proposed Changes to Original Scope

**3.1 State Management Enhancement**

- **Addition:** Potential Redux integration if project complexity requires advanced state management
- **Justification:** Context API remains primary approach for Version 1. Redux integration reserved for future versions if application complexity necessitates more sophisticated state management patterns

**3.2 Phased Development Approach**

- **Addition:** Implement iterative development strategy with defined version milestones
- **Justification:** Version 1 focuses on core MVP deliverables, with enhanced features (wishlist, reviews, admin dashboard) planned for subsequent versions. This approach ensures deployable functionality within timeline while allowing for future feature expansion based on user feedback and business requirements.
