# 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🎨 Application Design

I will use Figma for creating click-through designs of the e-commerce store. This will include:

- Product listing pages
- Product detail views
- Shopping cart interface
- Checkout flow
- User authentication screens

For styling, I'll implement SASS for custom styling solutions, allowing for:

- Reusable design variables
- Nested selectors
- Mixins for responsive design
- Modular CSS architecture

## ⚛️ Front End Framework

I will use Next.js as the primary framework, leveraging its key features:

- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- API routes for backend functionality
- Image optimization for product images
- Dynamic routing for product pages
- Built-in React components
- Static page generation for faster loading
- Incremental Static Regeneration for product updates

## 🏪 State Management

The state management solution will include:

- Next.js built-in data fetching methods
- Context API for cart management
- Local Storage for persisting cart items
- MongoDB for product and order data
- Auth0 for user session management

## 📡 Node

Next.js provides an integrated solution for both frontend and backend, using Node.js under the hood. I will utilize:

- API routes for server-side logic
- Environment variables for secure configuration
- NPM for package management
- Integration with external services (Stripe, Auth0)

## 🚀 Express

While Express won't be directly used (as Next.js handles routing), the API routes will be structured similarly with:

- RESTful endpoints for product management
- Authentication middleware using Auth0
- Route handlers for:
- Product queries
- Cart operations
- Order processing
- Payment integration with Stripe

## 🗄️ MongoDB

Instead of SQL/Postgres, I will use MongoDB as the database solution:

- Mongoose ODM for data modeling
- Schema validation
- CRUD operations for:
- Products
- Orders
- User data
- Indexing for search optimization
- Data relationships between:
- Users and Orders
- Products and Categories

## 🚀 Deployment

I will use Vercel for deploying the application, which provides:

- Continuous deployment
- Custom domain support
- Serverless functions
