## üõ°Ô∏è Defense-in-Depth Validation

### **Layer 1: Pre-commit Validation (scripts/check-todos.js)**

**Workflow Enhancement Feature:** Urban Echo provides an **optional workflow improvement** that automatically converts properly formatted TODO/FIX comments into GitHub issues, eliminating the need to manually create issues for every planned task or bug fix.

**Standard Options Available:**

- **Manual Issue Creation** - Use GitHub's conventional issue templates (always available)
- **Auto-Generation** - Use TODO/FIX comments for quick issue creation (workflow enhancement)

**Immediate feedback** during commit process using Husky and lint-staged integration for developers who choose to use the auto-generation feature:

#### **Auto-Generation Requirements (Optional Feature):**

_If you want TODO/FIX comments to automatically create GitHub issues, they must meet these professional standards:_

1. **Template Required** - Must include approved template like `[COMPONENT]`, `[SECURITY]`, etc.
2. **Single Template** - Only one template allowed per comment
3. **Valid Template** - Template must be from approved list
4. **Minimum Length** - Content after template must be ‚â•10 characters
5. **English Only** - No non-ASCII characters allowed
6. **Safe Characters** - No special characters that could break CLI tools
7. **Case Normalization** - Templates automatically converted to uppercase

#### **Benefits of Auto-Generation Workflow:**

- **Faster Development** - Create issues instantly while coding without context switching
- **Never Forget Tasks** - TODO/FIX comments become trackable issues automatically
- **Professional Standards** - All generated issues meet enterprise-grade requirements
- **Choice and Flexibility** - Developers can still use manual GitHub issue templates when preferred
- **Immediate Feedback** - Validation ensures comments meet standards before reaching repository

### **Layer 2: GitHub Actions Infrastructure Enforcement**

**Server-side validation** that cannot be bypassed by developers:

#### **Build Job:**

- Security scanning for hardcoded secrets and dangerous patterns
- Code quality validation with ESLint
- Build verification ensuring deployability
- Dependency vulnerability assessment

#### **Enforce-Standards Job:**

- ESLint standards enforcement with zero warnings tolerance
- TODO/FIX comment validation (backup to pre-commit)
- Comprehensive error reporting and failure details

#### **Security Analysis:**

- GitHub's CodeQL security scanning (automatic)
- Custom security pattern detection
- Vulnerability assessment and reporting

### **Layer 3: Branch Protection Rules**

**Repository-level enforcement** for critical branches:

#### **Main Branch (Production):**

- Required status checks: `build`, `enforce-standards`
- Pull request approval requirements
- Linear history enforcement
- Force push and deletion protection

#### **Staging Branch (Pre-production):**

- Required status checks: `build`, `enforce-standards`
- Pull request approval requirements
- Force push protection with deletion flexibility

#### **Dev Branch (Integration):**

- Required status checks: `build`
- Flexible workflow with force push capability
- Quality gate enforcement

## üîÑ Pre-commit Workflow and Team Collaboration

### **Automated Code Quality Pipeline**

Urban Echo implements a **team-coordinated workflow** using Husky, lint-staged, and Prettier to ensure consistent code quality across all team members. Team members can use their own prettier or formatting preferences during local development, because the workflow only applies team formatting standards to staged files through a temporary prettier configuration file during the commit process, leaving individual development environments completely untouched.

#### **Pre-commit Hook Process:**

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
npx lint-staged          # Formats staged files with team settings
npm run check-todos      # Validates TODO/FIX comment standards
```

#### **Staged File Processing (lint-staged):**

- **JavaScript/React files**: Prettier formatting ‚Üí ESLint fixing ‚Üí Re-staging
- **SASS/CSS files**: Prettier formatting ‚Üí Stylelint fixing ‚Üí Re-staging
- **Documentation**: Prettier formatting for consistency

#### **Team-Approved Formatting:**

```json
// .prettierrc.temp (generated during pre-commit)
{
  "arrowParens": "avoid",
  "bracketSameLine": true,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "htmlWhitespaceSensitivity": "css",
  "insertPragma": false,
  "jsxSingleQuote": false,
  "printWidth": 100,
  "proseWrap": "preserve",
  "quoteProps": "as-needed",
  "requirePragma": false,
  "semi": true,
  "singleAttributePerLine": false,
  "singleQuote": false,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "useTabs": false
}
```

#### **Benefits for Team Collaboration:**

- ‚úÖ **Developer Freedom** - Use your own prettier and formatting settings locally during development
- ‚úÖ **Staged Files Only** - Team formatting applied exclusively to staged files using temporary prettier file
- ‚úÖ **Local Development Untouched** - Personal prettier configurations remain active for local development work
- ‚úÖ **Temporary Prettier File** - Team standards applied via .prettierrc.temp only during commit process
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Repository Standards** - All committed code follows team formatting regardless of local settings
- ‚úÖ **Merge Conflict Prevention** - Automated formatting ensures consistent code style in the repository

#### **Workflow Integration:**

The pre-commit process works seamlessly with the existing TODO/FIX validation system, creating a **multi-layer quality gate** that ensures all code meets team standards before reaching the repository.

## üîß Infrastructure Enforcement

### **Workflow: Infrastructure-Level Enforcement**

**File:** `.github/workflows/strict-enforcement.yml`

#### **Build Job (Comprehensive Quality Gates):**

- **Security Scanning:** Detects hardcoded secrets (Stripe keys, API keys) and dangerous code patterns (eval, innerHTML, document.write)
- **Dependencies:** Installs and validates all project dependencies with npm ci
- **Code Quality:** Enforces ESLint standards with zero warnings tolerance
- **Build Verification:** Ensures successful production build with npm run build
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Scans dependencies with npm audit at high-severity threshold

#### **Enforce-Standards Job (Code Standards Validation):**

- **ESLint Validation:** Comprehensive code quality checks with detailed error reporting
- **TODO/FIX Standards:** Validates all TODO/FIX comments meet template and content requirements
- **Pre-commit Backup:** Serves as server-side validation backup to pre-commit hooks

#### **Security Analysis (GitHub CodeQL):**

- **CodeQL Integration:** GitHub's advanced security analysis with default setup
- **Automatic Scanning:** Runs on all pushes and pull requests to all branches
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies potential security issues and code quality problems
- **Results Integration:** Security findings appear in GitHub Security tab

### **Status Checks for Branch Protection:**

All protected branches require these status checks to pass before merging:

- `build` - Comprehensive quality, security, and build validation
- `enforce-standards` - Code standards and TODO/FIX comment validation
- `CodeQL / Analyze` - Advanced security analysis (GitHub's default CodeQL setup)

### **Automated Issue Creation and Project Integration**

**File:** `.github/workflows/auto-issue-creation.yml`

#### **TODO-to-Issue Job:**

- **Comment Processing:** Converts valid TODO/FIX comments into GitHub issues
- **Template Validation:** Pre-validated comments bypass server-side validation

- **Base Labeling:** Applies `auto-generated` and appropriate type labels

#### **Smart Labeling Job:**

- **Template Analysis:** Applies area, priority, and workflow labels based on template type
- **Content Detection:** Analyzes comment content for technology mentions and additional context
- **TODO vs FIX Logic:** Adjusts priority based on whether issue is planned work or bug fix
- **Auto-Assignment:** Assigns issues to the commit author for accountability

### **Personal Access Token Setup:**

For project board integration, the system uses a Personal Access Token with:

- **Scopes:** `repo` and `project` permissions
- **Storage:** Stored as `PROJECTS_SECRET` in repository secrets
- **Usage:** Enables automatic addition of issues to specified project board
